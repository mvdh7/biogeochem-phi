=== bgc_sliso() ===
- calculates isocapnic quotient (Q) from pCO2, DIC, temperature and salinity
- requires functions from https://github.com/mvdh7/oceancarb-constants

=== bgc_phi() ===
- calculates Phi from Q (output from bgc_sliso()) and biogeochemical process vector

=== bgc_normalise() ===
- optionally normalises a biogeochemical process vector to unit length
